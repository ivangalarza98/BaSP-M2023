# Mega Rocket GYM 

_The Mega Rocket GYM project is a gym website that serves as a tool to organize the activities of users, trainers, classes, among other things._

## Week 01 

```
We worked on figma, prototyped all the pages of the site and made the necessary connections. We made different groups where each one specialized 
in their section.

These sections are:

* Landing page
* Admin
* Coach
* Super admin
* Sign in
* Partners

```
## Week 02 

```
We created the landing page of the site based on the figma, respecting the semantics and structure. We do not have permission to use style tags, 
as the same will be added with css.

```

## Week 03 

```
We created the page of the landing page that we had created in figma in the first week, but this time adding the necessary css code for the 
correct visualization.

it contains the following elements:

* Header
* Navbar
* Form
* Img
* Links
* Main
* Footer

```

## Week 04 

```
We continue applying the css, but now using flexbox and making the page responsive. It must be displayed correctly on different devices 
(Mobile, tablet and desktop). For that we use media queries with the different sizes. 

We also create the github page to display the page:

This is [My Github Page](https://ivangalarza98.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04/index.html)

```
